Project Overview
This project is a simple MERN stack application designed to demonstrate how to build a full-stack web app with the following components:

Backend: Node.js and Express server with MongoDB as the database.
Frontend: React.js user interface that interacts with the backend through API calls.
This template is suitable for projects where you need to build a RESTful API on the backend and a dynamic, responsive user interface on the frontend.

Backend Setup
Prerequisites
Before setting up the backend, ensure that you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version)
MongoDB or a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation
Clone the repository:

 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-project.git
cd usercrud
Navigate to the Backend/ directory:

 
cd Backend
Install the required dependencies:

 
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend/ directory for environment variables, e.g.,:

makefile


MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mernstack
PORT=5000

MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string (replace with your own MongoDB URI if using MongoDB Atlas).
PORT: The port on which the backend will run (default is 5000).

Running the Backend
To start the backend server, run:

 
npm run dev
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following API endpoints:

GET /api/items: Fetch all items from the database.
POST /api/items: Add a new item to the database.
GET /api/items/:id: Get a single item by its ID.
PUT /api/items/:id: Update an item by its ID.
DELETE /api/items/:id: Delete an item by its ID.

Frontend Setup
Prerequisites
Before setting up the frontend, ensure that you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation
Navigate to the frontend/ directory:

 
cd frontend
Install the required dependencies:

 
npm install
Create a .env file in the frontend/ directory for frontend environment variables, e.g.,:

 
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_API_URL: The URL of the backend API (default is http://localhost:5000/api).
Running the Frontend
To start the frontend development server, run:

 
npm start
The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
